        <p>ECMAScript (ES) is a scripting language specification standardized by ECMAScript International. It is used by applications to enable client-side scripting. The specification is influenced by programming languages like Self, Perl, Python, Java etc. Languages like JavaScript, script and ActionScript are governed by this specification.</p>
<p>This tutorial introduces you to ES6 implementation in JavaScript.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>JavaScript</h2>
<p>JavaScript was developed by Brendan Eich, a developer at NetscapeCommunications Corporation, in 1995.JavaScript started life with the name Mocha, and was briefly named LiveScript before being officially renamed to JavaScript. It is a scripting language that is executed by the browser, i.e. on the client&#39;s end. It is used in conjunction with HTML to develop responsive webpages.</p>
<p>ECMA Script6&#39;s implementation discussed here covers the following new features</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for constants</li>
<li>Block Scope</li>
<li>Arrow Functions</li>
<li>Modules</li>
<li>Classes</li>
<li>Iterators</li>
<li>Promises</li>
<li>more ...</li>
</ul>

        <p>JavaScript can run on any browser, any host, and any OS. You will need the following to write and test a JavaScript program standard:</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Text Editor</h2>
<p>The text editor helps you to write your source code. Examples of few editors include Windows Notepad, Notepad++, Emacs, vim or vi etc. Editors used may vary with the operating systems. The source files are typically named with the <strong>extension .js</strong></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Installing Node.js</h2>
<p>Node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for server-side JavaScript. Node.is is required to run JavaScript without a browser support. It uses Google V8 JavaScript engine to execute the code. You may download Node.js source code or a pre-built installer for your platform. Node is available at <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download" target="_blank">https://nodejs.org/en/download</a></p>
<h3 is-upgraded>Installation on Windows</h3>
<p>Download and run the <strong>.msi installer</strong> for Node</p>
<p>To verify if the installation was successful, enter the command <code>node -v</code> in the terminal window.</p>
<h3 is-upgraded>Installation on Mac OS X</h3>
<p>To install node.js on OS X you can download a pre-compiled binary package which makes a nice and easy installation. Head over to <a href="www.nodejs.org" target="_blank">www.nodejs.org</a> and click the install button to download the latest package.</p>
<p>Install the package from the <strong>.dmg</strong> by following along the install wizard which will install both <strong>node</strong> and <strong>npm</strong>. Npm is the Node Package Manager which facilitates installs of additional packages for Node.js.</p>
