# Title


<!-- ------------------------ -->
## 1. Setting up your Express.jS application
Duration: 00:05:00

### Basic initiation of the project
To begin creating the application, type the following lines into your terminal.

```
$ mkdir myapp
$ cd myapp
$ npm init
$ npm install expressâ€Š--save
```

### Hellow world Express application
Add the following code to an app.js file in the myapp directory. Now we have a Node.js application running with the express framework thanks to this simple configuration.

```
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const port = 3000

app.get('/', (req, res) => {res.send('Hello World!')
})
app.listen(port, () => {console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${port}`)
```

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## The Setup

First we need to install NodeJS if it is not already done. Head over to https://nodejs.org and install the latest LTS version.

Once NodeJS installed, create a new folder for our new NodeJS project. Navigate to your new folder in your terminal and execute `npm init`. You'll have to choose a title, description and other options for our project. I called my main file `index.js`.

That's all for the setup phase, let's start coding!

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Web server with ExpressJS

Let's launch a web server using ExpressJS! First, we need to install the `express` package. To install a package simply execute `npm install --save <package-name>`, in our case, the package name is `express` so we will enter `npm install --save express`.

The option `--save` (or `-S`) will add the package to the list of dependencies listed in your `package.json` file. This is particularly interesting if you need to install your project in a new environment and to avoid adding the `node_modules` folder in your repository which is a **very bad** idea. If you want to reinstall your project with all its dependencies, simply execute `npm install`.

Now, we'll need to create our `index.js` file. This file will be the main file we will be using.

Let's start by adding our `express` module to our code.

```js
const express = require('express')
```

*Note: NodeJS now supports ESNext (ES6+). You can use let/const, async/await, and all the cool features available in new versions of JavaScript.*

Now, let's initialize a new web server.

```js
const app = express()
```

And we can finally launch our web server on the port of our choice. Let's say `3000`. We'll also add an index route to our server.

```js
const PORT = 3000

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello GDG Galway!')
})

app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server listening on port ${PORT}...`)
})
```

*Note: logs/warnings/errors will be displayed in the terminal used to launch your NodeJS application.*

That's it! We're done. We have a running web server. Let's run our code by executing `node index.js`. Yay! The server is running! We can go to http://localhost:3000 and check if our server works.

Let's create a proper static HTML file to serve. We'll create a new folder called `static` and create `hello.html`. Let's add some code into it.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <title>Hello!</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello GDG Galway!</h1>
    </body>
</html>
```

To serve static files, we'll need to add a simple line to our main file.

```js
app.use(express.static(`${__dirname}/static/`))
```

*Note: The global variable `__dirname` is the path to your NodeJS project folder.*

If we relaunch our application with `node index.js`, and go to http://localhost:3000/hello.html, we should see the content of our HTML file!


We'all ready to code our new route in `index.js`.

```js
const fs = require('fs')
const request = require('request-promise-native')
const mustache = require('mustache')

app.get('/todos', async (req, res) => {
    // Get the content of 'todos.html'
    const template = fs.readFileSync('templates/todos.html', 'UTF-8')
    // Get our list of todos in JSON format
    const todos = await request('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos?userId=1', { json: true })
    // Generate the HTML content from our list of todos
    const html = mustache.render(template, { todos })
    // Serve the final content
    res.send(html)
})
```

Let's see the result of our new route by relaunching our app and going to http://localhost:3000/todos. We should see our list of todos.

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Dynamic routing

Let's change the content of our page depending on the variables passed in our route. We will list our pending tasks and our completed tasks by creating two additional routes.

```js
app.get('/todos/:status', async (req, res) => {
    // Get our dynamic status parameter
    const {status} = req.params
    // Is the status we're looking for Completed or not?
    const completed = status === 'completed'
    // Get the content of 'todos.html'
    const template = fs.readFileSync('templates/todos.html', 'UTF-8')
    // Get our list of todos in JSON format
    const todos = await request('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos?userId=1', { json: true })
    // Generate the HTML content from our list of filtered todos based on their status
    const html = mustache.render(template, {
        todos: todos.filter(todo => todo.completed === completed)
    })
    // Serve the final content
    res.send(html)
})
```

If we relaunch our app and try to access http://localhost:3000/todos/pending and http://localhost:3000/todos/completed, we should see our list of pending tasks and completed tasks! Awesome stuff :D
