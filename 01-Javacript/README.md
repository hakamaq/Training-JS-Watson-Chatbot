ECMAScript (ES) is a scripting language specification standardized by ECMAScript
International. It is used by applications to enable client-side scripting. The
specification is influenced by programming languages like Self, Perl, Python, Java etc. Languages like JavaScript, script and ActionScript are governed by this specification.

This tutorial introduces you to ES6 implementation in JavaScript.

### JavaScript

JavaScript was developed by Brendan Eich, a developer at NetscapeCommunications Corporation, in 1995.JavaScript started life with the name Mocha, and was briefly named LiveScript before being officially renamed to JavaScript. It is a
scripting language that is executed by the browser, i.e. on the client's end. It is used in conjunction with HTML to develop responsive webpages.

ECMA Script6's implementation discussed here covers the following new features
- Support for constants
- Block Scope
- Arrow Functions
- Modules
- Classes
- Iterators

JavaScript can run on any browser, any host, and any OS. You will need the following to write and test a JavaScript program standard:

### Text Editor

The text editor helps you to write your source code. Examples of few editors include Windows Notepad, Notepad++, Emacs, vim or vi etc. Editors used may vary with the operating systems. The source files are typically named with the **extension .js**

### Installing Node.js

Node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for server-side JavaScript. Node.is is required to run JavaScript without a browser support. It uses Google V8 JavaScript engine to execute the code. You may download Node.js source code or a pre-built installer for your platform. Node is available at [https://nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

#### Installation on Windows

Download and run the **.msi installer** for Node 

To verify if the installation was successful, enter the command `node -v` in the
terminal window.

#### Installation on Mac OS X
To install node.js on OS X you can download a pre-compiled binary package which makes a nice and easy installation. Head over to [www.nodejs.org](www.nodejs.org) and click the install button to download the latest package.

Install the package from the **.dmg** by following along the install wizard which will install both **node** and **npm**. Npm is the Node Package Manager which facilitates installs of additional packages for Node.js.
